        <p>ARTIST STATEMENT: </p>
  
        <p2>For project 2, I wanted to work with fantastical data to create a small bestiary of creatures of doodles and sketches I made. This love for drawing little creatures and characters has always been a part of me. As a kid, I loved creating creatures based on whatever I was currently into. I drew many monsters based on series I liked such as Legends of Zelda, Pokemon, and Avatar. As I've grown that love has never left.
